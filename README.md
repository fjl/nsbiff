# nsbiff

nsbiff is a silly OS X menu bar app that displays the count of unread messages in
my Maildir. I threw this together in 3 hours. This is "works for me" software that
doesn't come with a preferences panel.

If you still want to run this, just execute `xcodebuild` to generate an app bundle.
You can also open the project in XCode and click the play button.
